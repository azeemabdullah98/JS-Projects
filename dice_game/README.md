# Dice Game

## Rules:

This game requires two player to play. A player starts by rolling the dice from 1-6. If the player rolls any number other than 1, then his/her score will be updated in the current score. Then he/she can either hold the score by pressing the hold button which will update the total score but the current player's turn will be passed to the other player. If the player rolls 1, then no score will be updated and the turn will be passed to the next player. The first person to reach the score of 100 will be declared as winner.
